#angular-may-9th
this is a homework assignment.
the object was to use webpack and angular and express to write text to
an h1 header with an input box, and to have a button that deletes the text.
Also, a css file was to be included as well.
When you run gulp, it updates the build with any changes to css or html.
This was fun.
I xoxo css!!!
